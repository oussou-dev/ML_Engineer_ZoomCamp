### **Description**

When youâ€™ve been devastated by a serious car accident, your focus is on the things that matter the most: family, friends, and other loved ones.   
Pushing paper with your insurance agent is the last place you want your time or mental energy spent.   
This is why [Allstate](https://www.allstate.com/), a personal insurer in the United States, is continually seeking fresh ideas to improve their claims service for the over 16 million households they protect.
